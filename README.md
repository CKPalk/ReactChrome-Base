# React Chrome Extension Boilerplate

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

## Development

* Run script
```bash
# build files to './dev'
# start webpack development server
$ npm run dev
```

#### React/Redux hot reload

This boilerplate uses `Webpack` and `react-transform`, and use `Redux`. You can hot reload by editing related files of Popup & Window & Inject page.

#### Using Redux DevTools Extension

You can use [redux-devtools-extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) on development mode.

## Build

```bash
# build files to './build'
$ npm run build
```

## Compress

```bash
# compress build folder to {manifest.name}.zip and crx
$ npm run build
$ npm run compress -- [options]
```

## How it Works

#### State Management

App state is saved to `chrome.storage.local`.

#### Window

The context menu is created by [chrome/extension/background/contextMenus.js](chrome/extension/background/contextMenus.js).

#### Inject page

The inject script is being run by [chrome/extension/background/inject.js](chrome/extension/background/inject.js).

If you are receiving the error message `Failed to load resource: net::ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE`, you need to allow invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost. You can do this by visiting the following URL: `chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost` and enabling **Allow invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost**.
